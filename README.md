1 Take a look at this useless box example and try to create one out of paper in less than 30 minutes.

2 Where will the switch, Arduino, and servo go?

Switch will have to be outside on the top side of the box. Arduino and servo would have to be inside the box. 
Servo would have to move the hook (or finger?) from the center of the inside of the box so that the hook can lift up the top part to reach the outer surface of the top side of the box. So the servo probably needs to be fixed in the inner center wall of the box. 
Arduino can be on the inner bottom side of the box so that wiring can be inserted easily.

3 Submit a picture of your paper prototype! Bonus points if you submit a timelapse of the process.
